###Milestone 3 Feedback
Really awesome mockups here. Your Milestone 3 passes at Tier IV.
 
##Suggestions
- Take a look at Bootstrap's [Scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) plugin, and [static navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-static-top)
- Bypass the project detail pages for now for the sake of MVP. Awesome feature going forward, however.
- Become familiar with [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), and become an expert at the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-example-basic). Both of these things will help you create your layout very efficiently.
